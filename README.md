# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
Apply Python skills and knowledge of pandas to create new dataframe of the ride-sharing data by city type. Base on the new dataframe and generate multiple lines which represent different city types to show the total weekly fares. Use the line chart and new dataframe to analysis and give to decision makers at PyBer for further decisions.

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
**Get a Summary DataFrame**

- From above the summary dataframe, we will know the Urban city has the most of rides and drivers and also the total fares is the higest one. However, the highest average fare per ride and per driver belongs to Rural city, above situation will help decision makers to consider the type of the profitable city could be rural city.

**Create a multiple line plot that shows the total weekly of the fares for each type of city**

- By seeing the multiple lines above, y-axis shows the total weekly fare amounts for each type of city and x-axis shows date of 2019-01-01 to 2019-04-29 each week. Three of cities reach to the peak at the end of Feb together, after that three of them all showing the decreasing trends, the Urban city was decreasing relatively slow. The Suburban city started to decrease first then went to peak again at the end of April, while the Rural city type dropped.

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
- The results of the summary DataFrame could be the Rural city types are more profitable, which has higher average fare per ride and per driver. 
- Since there are more total drivers and total rides in the Urban city types. PyBer needs to think of an efficient marketing strategy in the Urban city types to increase the total rides dollar amounts or risk losing Urban drivers.
- PyBer needs to consider expand the effects on Rural cities and Suburban cities to gain more business and drivers.
